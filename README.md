# Analytics Vidhya Hackathons
1) [Recommendation Engine]()

This repository contains solution for the Recommendation Design Hackathon hosted by Analytics Vidhya. I created a ALS based implicit feedback model for recommending three new problems to a user on a coding challenge website. 

2) [Stroke Prediction]()

This is a classification problem to predict whether a person will get stroke or not given his/her medical conditions. The problem is taken from McKinsey Analytics Hackathon on Analytics Vidhya.
