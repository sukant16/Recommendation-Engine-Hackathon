# Analytics Vidhya Hackathons
1) [Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/sukant16/Analytics-Vidhya-Hackathons/tree/master/Recommendation%20Engine)

Analytics Vidhya hosted an online [hackathon](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/mckinsey-analytics-online-hackathon-recommendation/) for Mckinsey Analytics which involved designing a recommendation system for a website hosting coding challenges. Every user in the training dataset has done 13 problems out of 5348 problems and in the test set, each user has done 10 problems and we needed to recommend next three problems to the user in the test set. Since there is no ranking involved, I implemented **ALS based implicit feedback collaborative filtering model** in python which got me 12th rank in the competition. You can find my notebook [here](https://github.com/sukant16/Recommendation-Engine-Hackathon/blob/master/Rec_Engine.ipynb).

2) [Stroke Prediction](https://github.com/sukant16/Analytics-Vidhya-Hackathons/tree/master/Stroke%20Prediction)

This is a classification problem to predict whether a person will get stroke or not given his/her medical conditions. The problem is taken from McKinsey Analytics Hackathon on Analytics Vidhya.
